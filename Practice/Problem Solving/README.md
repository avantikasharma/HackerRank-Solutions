Codes written in this section are a mix of Python2 and Python3.

It takes considerable amount of time to segregate these into different languages. 

In case you wish to help me, please leave a comment on the python file stating the language used to code. You may write the comment in this format:

" Python code for </problem-name/> written on <Python2/Python3>"

Your effort will help others utilise the code without much giving much efforts in correcting the syntactical errors.
